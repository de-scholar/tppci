This project is for preventing or caring **Teenage Pregnancy**. The computerized application which is being developped will have the following functionalities:

- **Public Website** : which will be in charge of publications, news, actions, and updating about currently happenings.

- **Registering System:** which is a way of registering new identified case, from anywhere.
  - _This this registering system is made of two possibilities: You can register using computer; it means website, or you can do so using your mobile phone just by using USSD code wich will be prvided when the app is fully fuctioning_

* **Reporting System:** which will be in charge of delivering reports of data such as current registered cases, pregnant teenages, high risk teenages, delivered teenages for just further special care

# USSD SYSTEM

The USSD stands for Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), which is sometimes referred to as "Quick Codes" or "Feature codes". In the ttpci software, this service will be enabled, inorder to enhance our beneficiaries experience.

This means whether a user has an internet connection, or not, he/she will be able to interract with the system.

below are detailed information about it:

1. For example a teenage who doesn't have a smartphone, or a computer or he/she may even have those devices but still without any internet connection to enable him/her to access the online system, and he/she needs a help or an assistance to access information.

   - => In this case, that teenage will use his simple cellphone by dialing a code let's say for example \*253# and he/she will follow instructions directing him/her to the information or a service.

2. The second example is when a service provider, like a healthcenter nurse or a primary school teacher who went back home, where there is no internet connection, or the internet connection is poor, but he/she have a case to report (to register).

   - =>he/she may be able to do so by dialing some code (\*253#).

3. Another usefull case of this USSD system, is raising awareness through sending automated sms.

   - Any new registered case, or anyone who tried to interact with the system, automatically the system will take her/his personal information including her/his phone number, this will be of a great help because, after some time (periodically), the system will keep sending him/her sms, to update him/her.

   - Sometimes at schools, teachers or other school authorities, they can see some students (girls), because of their behaviour, they are at high risk of getting pregnant, throught difference conferences and public awareness raising campaign, we will encourge them to register, those high risk cases, with their phone numbers, this will help those students to get customized sms, to make them aware and interest them to be cautious, and if sending their parents sms, to remind them about education of their children.

_ALL OF THE ABOVE USSD SYSTEM FEATURES ARE AVAILE TO, FOR SOMEONE WHO USES COMPUTER_

_THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO MAKE ZERO LIMITATIONS TO THE ACCESS OF SERVICES_
